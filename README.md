<summary>Training</summary>

The commands below reproduce YOLOv5 [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh)
results. [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models)
and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) download automatically from the latest
YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Training times for YOLOv5n/s/m/l/x are
1/2/4/6/8 days on a V100 GPU ([Multi-GPU](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/475) times faster). Use the
largest `--batch-size` possible, or pass `--batch-size -1` for
YOLOv5 [AutoBatch](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/5092). Batch sizes shown for V100-16GB.
